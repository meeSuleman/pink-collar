Behave as solution architect of a Saas based project. You have to built an database architecture of a simple project. Here is the scenario:
It is a rails web app like a candidate portal for applying to job posts.
Currently we have 2 types of users admin and a candidate. Candidate can apply by filling a form data that will be saved in a table and admin will just log in and see the data against candidates on the dashboard then we have a listing page for the candidates and a show page against a single candidate same for the admins listing page and show page. Also there is a feature from which an admin can send an invite link to the some other admin then an email will be sent to him and on clicking a link in email he can register himself in the same portal and can view everything.
Only admin can log in and there credentials would be seeded we don't have any sign up functionality yet only log in for admins and candidates donot have any kind of registration thing neither log in functionality they only can apply using  a form.

give me the database structure 
also give me a well defined prompt for this whole requirement so i can give it to an AI model which can write code for me.
